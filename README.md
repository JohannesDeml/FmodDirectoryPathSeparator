# FmodDirectoryPathSeparator

This repo offers an easy fix for the different directory spearator characters on differnt OSes. It keeps on directory path and creates a nonserializd string that holds the correct representation for the platform. This way, there won't be any extra commits in git when switching platforms on a regular basis.

The solution was tested with Unity 5.6.0f3 and FMOD 1.09.04, a discussion thread is over here: http://www.fmod.org/questions/question/source-project-path-directory-separator-on-windows-different-to-mac/
